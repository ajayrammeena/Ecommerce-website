# Ecommerce-website
 This is e-commerce website While managing the backend architecture using Express and Node.js, I created an accessible user interface using React. I brought in user-friendly features, including simple shopping cart navigation, easy logins, and efficient product management and search capabilities. When creating the admin and user dashboards, I included a safe online payment system with ease. The endeavor resulted in a triumphant debut on the Cyclic platform, exhibiting a refined layout and flawless functionality.
